Run the full Black Box Software Factory pipeline on this project.
Start from Phase 0 (Complexity Assessment) then Phase 1 through Phase 7.
Read GEMINI.md for orchestration rules, model assignments, and quality gates.
Auto-commit after each phase. Ask for user approval only at clarification rounds.
You MUST use the zen MCP server for non-Gemini model roles — do NOT do everything yourself.
Maintain the audit log at artifacts/reports/audit-log.md throughout.
